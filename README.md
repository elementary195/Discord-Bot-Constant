# Discord-Bot-Constant

<b>Used for demonstration purposes only. Not for copy/install on your own server.</b>
This bot works in conjunction with another bot - VoiceMaster (or another one that provides the ability, by clicking, to create a new voice channel).
Purpose:
By clicking on the "Join to create" button, the VoiceMaster bot, as already mentioned, creates a voice channel, where it then transfers the user who created it. This bot allows you to additionally create a text channel with the same name as the voice channel, making it invisible to other users. Only users who are in the voice channel have access to such a channel.
